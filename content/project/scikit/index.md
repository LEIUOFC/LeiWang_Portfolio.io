To further develop me experise in machine leanring and deep learning. I have enrolled in online coursees in [machine learning](https://coursera.org/share/d689a33ebde9ddfb4dce75334c751462) and [deep learning](https://coursera.org/share/71f8f1aa4bc1ef35558a91f233c5bdec).These case studies covers  (un)supervised learning, Neural Networks, Random Forests, Recommenders, Rinforcement learning, Structuring Machine Learning Projects, Convolutional Neural Networks, Hyperparameter Tuning, Regularzation and Optimizations, and Sequence Models.
