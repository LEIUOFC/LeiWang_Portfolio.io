Lei have studied machine learning concepts, including supervised learning (linear regression, logistic regression, neural networks, decision trees), unsupervised learning (clustering, anomaly detection), recommender systems, and reinforcement learning. Lei have learned some of the best practices for building machine learning models and also gained practical skills to apply machine learning techniques to challenging real-world problems.

Lei have built neural network architectures such as Convolutional Neural Networks, Recurrent
Neural Networks, LSTMs, Transformers, and learned how to make them better with strategies such as Dropout, BatchNorm, and Xavier/He initialization. Lei mastered these theoretical concepts,learned their industry applications using Python and TensorFlow, and tackled real-world cases such as speech recognition, music synthesis, chatbots, machine translation, natural language processing, and more
