abstract = {Clathrate hydrate nucleation in heterogeneous systems, such as the water-in-oil emulsions found in pipeline environments, is of considerable technological importance and scientific interest. While there has been a number of experimental studies investigating hydrate nucleation in water-in-oil emulsions, there have been essentially no molecular simulations to provide important molecular insights into the hydrate nucleation process. Here, we report extensive molecular dynamics simulations of gas hydrate nucleation to examine nucleation behavior in water nanodroplets immersed in a non-aqueous liquid, probing key factors impacting nucleation, including guest species, guest compositions, size of the nanodroplets, and temperature. The nucleation behavior with pure-guest (i.e., H2S, C3H8, and CO2) and H2S-containing mixtures, where the second guest species is one of C3H8, CH4, C2H6, and CO2, has been studied. For the various systems examined in this study, we find that H2S always tends to initiate hydrate formation,},
